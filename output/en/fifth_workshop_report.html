      <p>Our fifth workshop took place on 17. 12. 2021, again in the form of online
conference. Its main topics were the concept of nature in mathematical physics
and naturalized philosophy of physics. RNDr. Ladislav Kvasz, DSc., Dr. from the
Department of Mathematics and Mathematical Education of Faculty of Education of
Charles University in Prague was a guest speaker at the workshop. Another
speaker was one of our researchers Mgr. Róbert Maco, PhD. from the Department of
Philosophy and History of Philosophy of the Faculty of Arts of Comenius
University in Bratislava. </p>
<p><img src="/en/images/fifth_workshop_1.png" style="width:760px"></p>
<p>At the beginning of the event dr. Adam Greif introduced the speakers by way of
highlighting some of their published works closely related to the topic at hand.
Then he summarized the content and argumentative strategy of both contributions
on the basis of previously provided annotations. </p>
<p>Prof. Ladislav Kvasz was the first one to present his ideas under the title „The
Conception of Nature in Mathematical Physics“. The main aim of this presentation
was to offer an explication of the concept of mathematisation of nature as a
process, which is supposed to have three phases, each involving a certain kind
of reduction enabling us to substitute a certain aspect of reality with its
mathematical representation. While this reduction does empoverish the image of
nature somewhat, it also provide us with a new kind of synthesis, made possible
through the use of mathematical language. According to prof. Kvasz, the first
phase of mathematisation consists in „phenomenological reduction“, that is, in
substituting phenomena with mathematical quantities. Second one involves
„ontological reduction“, or, in other words, the substitution of bodies with
descriptions of their states. Introducing a state makes possible the
compositional synthesis. Finally, the third phase is the „causal reduction“,
which means the substitution of causes with the operation of forces. The
consequence of this reduction is so called deductive synthesis, or the
linguistic capacity to infer deductively from a state at given time a state at
subsequent times. </p>
<p><img src="/en/images/fifth_workshop_2.png" style="width:760px"></p>
<p>the presentation of prof. kvasz prompted an extensive discussion. some workshop
participants asked prof. kvasz to clarify some of the technical terms he
used in the presentation (e.g., the concepts of
epistemic contact, epistemic axis, reduction etc.). prof. kvasz has also
attempted to explain in more detail his quasiempirical conception of mathematics
and the concept of mathematical experience. another problem which showed itself
to be important was the question of whether or how it is possible to
(re)identify one and the same object presented through the lenses of different
theoretical conceptions.  </p>
<p><img src="/en/images/fifth_workshop_3.png" style="width:760px"></p>
<p>The second presentation, given by dr. Róbert Maco, was titled as „Naturalised
Philosophy of Physics (between mathematics and physics)“. Dr. Maco started with
a reminder of critical claims made by distinguished theoretical physicist
Steven Weinberg regarding the philosophy of science of 90s. Weinberg presented
philosophy (in sharp contrast with mathematics) as virtually irrelevant for
actual physical research, particulary in relation to the search for the „final
theory“. Most philophers flatly rejected Weinberg's view, mainly by pointing out
that he does not understand correctly the role which the philosophy is supposed
to have. In opposition to these negative reactions, dr. Maco attempted to show
that the hastly rejection of Weinberg's view is detrimental to attempts to
develop naturalized (theoretical) philosophy, which is, according to Maco,
naturalized insofar as it is immanent. The main message of the
presentation was expressed as an appeal for the physics and philosophy (of
physics) to be conceived as parts of one and the same process mainly aiming at
better understanding of how the world acutaly works. As an example of
philosophically motivated and exceptionally important physical contribution dr.
Maco gave a detailed presentation of a theoretical prediction of the so called
Aharanov-Bohm effect, which gives us surprising observable effects thanks to
combination of electromagnetism and quantum mechanics. According to the authors
of the 1959 paper, these effects force us to fundamentally rethink the
physical nature of certain quantities. </p>
<p><img src="/en/images/fifth_workshop_4.png" style="width:760px"></p>
<p>Subsequent discussion was centered around two crucial points - the proposed form
of the relation between the philosophy of physics and physics and the adequacy
of the illustration given in the presentation relative to its main aim. Workshop
participants highlighted some problematic moments in the proposed conception of
the philosophy of physics in their questions and comments. The main objections
against the view that the philosophy of physics is supposed to participate in
actual physical research was a reminder that the contemporary theoretical and
mathematical physics is extremely technically demanding. </p>
