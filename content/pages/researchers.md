Our research team consists of pedagogical and scientific workers at
the Department of Philosophy and History of Philosophy, a constituent
of Faculty of Arts of the Comenius University in
Bratislava. Scientific and research profiles of individual researchers
cover all main philosophical disciplines. The department regularly
organizes scientific conferences and publishes scientific anthology
Philosophica. The department also closely cooperates with the
Department of Logic and Methodology of Science and cultivates
collaboration with multiple foreign institutions (Universität Wien,
FF and FHS UK Praha, FF MU Brno, FF UP Olomouc, Filosofický Ústav AV
ČR Praha, FF OSU Ostrava and FF UP Pardubice).
