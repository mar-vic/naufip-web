The first of our series of workshops dedicated to various aspects and
questions of naturalism conceived as an universal philosophcal programme has
taken the place on wednesday the 6th of november 2019. The topic of workshop was 
the issue of human nature as seen from the perspective of aristotelian and
neoaristotelian philosophy. Two guests have accepted our invitation to present
their ideas at the event: Doc. Mgr. Petr Dvořák, PhD. from the Czech Academy of
Sciences and Palacký University in Olomouc, and Doc. Mgr. Marian Kuna, MA,
MPhil, PhD. form the Catholic University in Ružomberok. Our own team was
represented by projects' principal investigator Prof. Mgr. Michal Chabada, PhD.

Petr Dvořák has spoken about the problem of natural kinds and essentialism. He has
focused on M. Nussbaums' conception of human nature as a collection of
dispositions and functions indispensable for human well-being, as well as on the
related theory of rational action authored by Ch. Koorsgaard.

Michal Chabada has dealt with the way in which the theory of human nature can be
based on the principles of aristotelian ethical naturalism, according to
philosopher Ph. Foot. In particular, Chabada has brought into focus the problem
of rational will as it relates to human needs and, more broadly, human life, and
to natural norms and their application to human virtues.

Marián Kuna introduced an aristotelian approach towards the question of human
nature in the writings of A. MacIntyre. He has traced MacIntyres movement
towards sociologically inspired aristotelianism and, subsequently, towards the
understanding of human nature motivated by Thomism.

In the ensuing discussion, workshop participants were primarily appreciative of the fact that 
Aristotles (or broadly aristotelian) philosophy is being systematically
reexamined. Several of them have pointed out that the fruitfulness of this
approach is sugggested by its compatiblity with contemporary biological or
evolutionary accounts of humans.
