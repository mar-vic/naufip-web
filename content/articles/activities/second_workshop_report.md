The second in our series of workshops has taken the place on thursday the 17th
of september 2020. Workshop was dedicated to the questions of naturalism in
epistemology and ethics, in particular to the naturalistic positions on their
intersections. Two foreign guests from Philosophical Faculty of Placaký
University Olomouc have presented their ideas: Mgr. Filip Tvrdý, Ph.D. a Mgr.
Petra Chudárková. Our own team was represented by Mgr. Martin Nuhíček, PhD.

In the first talk "Versions of naturalism in epistemology", Martin Nuhlíček has
characterized naturalistic positions in contemporary epistemology relative to
their traditional, non-naturalistic alternatives. He then distinguished radical
eleminative naturalism and its moderate, cooperative version.

The focus of Filip Tvrdý's presentation "Naturalized epistemology of vices" was
virtue epistemology and its counterpart, the epistemology of vices. According to
Tvrdý, cognitive lazyness, that is, the inability or unwillingness to justify ones
beliefs, and metacognitive incompetence, which amounts to one being to unable or
unwilling to recognize ones errors, are two principal epistemic vices. Tvrdý
also claimed that these vices can be naturalized with the help of various
investigations in psychology and cognitive sciences.

Finally, in her presentation "Naturalism in moral epistemology", Petra Chudárková
first considered some ways in which intuitionism and coherentism
deals with the problem of moral justification and knowledge. She has found these
solutions lacking and proposed that naturalized approach in ethics, being 
constrained by empirical evidence and scientific method, is a plausible
alternative to solve given problems.

All three speakers have pointed out some ways in which some aspects of
epistemology or ethics could be naturalized. However, the question of the
ability of naturalistic approaches to make traditional epistemology and ethics
eventually obsolete proved to be controversial, in the ensuing discussion.
