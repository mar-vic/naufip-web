We are proud to announce that we will be hosting an international science conference: Naturalistic Image of the World: Challenges and Limits. The conference is scheduled for september the 2nd and 3rd 2021 at the Faculty of Arts of Comenius University in room G-236 on the second floor of faculty building at the Gondova street in Bratislava.

We host the conference in order to summarize and evaluate the results of our ongoing reasearch project APVV-18-0178 Naturalism as an universal philosophical programme, which is in its half-time. In addition, we will outline the direction of our research for the rest of the projects timeline.

The main aim of the conference is to present a complex and critical look at the foundations and aims of naturalism, make contributions to the analysis of the gradual penetration of naturalistic approaches to the phiosophical subdisciplines, and evaluate their internal limits, mainly in instances in which the approaches suffer philosophical and methodological problems.

In addition to the permanent members of our team, various distinguished foreign quests have accepted our invitation to present their ideas at the conference: prof. Martin Hähnel (DE), prof. Herlinde Pauer-Studer and prof. Angela Kallhoff from the University of Vienna, as well as several colleagues from czech universities (doc. Radim Bělohrad, dr. Antonín Dolák, dr. Roman Hloch, dr. Filip Tvrdý, Mgr. Petra Chudárková).

All are cordially invited!
