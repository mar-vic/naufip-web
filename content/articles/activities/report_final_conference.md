The International Conference titled "Naturalism as a universal philosophical
program" took place on May 4-5, 2023 at the Faculty of Philosophy of Comenius
University within the homonymous APVV project, in which members of the
Department of Philosophy and History of Philosophy are involved. As was
emphasized by the project leader Michal Chabada in his opening
speech, the event was the culmination and summary of a five-year work on the topic of philosophical
naturalism. The character of the final conference was reflected in the individual
presentations of the members of the research team and in the subsequent discussions,
which referred to and built upon the results of the previous work.

The main speakers of the conference were invited guests from several foreign
universities: Philip Kitcher from Columbia University in the USA (via online
connection), Martin Hähnel from the University of Bremen, and Winfried Löffler
from the University of Innsbruck. The most attention and deservedly the most
extensive discussion was devoted to Philip Kitcher's lecture. The central theme
of his contribution was the problem of progress in morality and ethics, which he
addressed against the background of his pragmatically oriented naturalistic
philosophy. P. Kitcher convincingly defended and explained the possibility of
progress not only in the field of science but also in the moral sphere, based on
the distinction between two types of progress: teleological and pragmatic, where
the latter means not approaching a pre-established distant goal, but rather
overcoming problems associated with the current situation. In the subsequent
discussion, P. Kitcher very willingly and in detail answered several additional
questions, including an interesting clarification of the connections between his
earlier work in the field of the philosophy of mathematics and biological
sciences and his current inclination towards topics in moral and social
philosophy.


In his lecture, Martin Hähnel also addressed problems from practical philosophy,
but this time from the perspective of Aristotelian naturalism, which argues for
the possibility of deriving some normative statements from statements about
relevant forms of life, ultimately leading to (for many controversial) appeals
to human nature. M. Hähnel defended the thesis that science itself is not
capable of answering the question of human nature, so philosophy still has the
task of finding (or at least seeking) unity of reason and nature, if we want to
avoid returning to Kantina ethical formalism or utilitarism.

Winfried Löffler succeeded in capturing the audience's attention with his
presentation, in which he critically responded to the (ontological) naturalism
position by attempting to prove that the naturalist is faced with a dilemma of
either adopting a position that is demonstrably untrue or philosophically
uninteresting. According to Löffler, the existence of true beliefs that are not
reducible to the scientific realm demonstrates that reductive naturalism is
false, while naturalism formulated in a more liberal manner tends to become a
trivial position and therefore loses its interest.

The conference was significantly enriched by the speeches of three Czech
philosophers: Petr Dvořák (University of Ostrava), Petra Chudárková (University
of Hradec Králové), and Filip Tvrdý (Comenius University). In his lecture, P.
Dvořák presented a naturalistic solution to the problem of individuation from
the perspective of James Ladyman's ontic structural realism. Petra Chudárková
emphasized the need to connect ethics as a philosophical discipline with
empirical scientific research in the form of naturalized ethics, and from this
perspective, she also addressed the problem of moral progress. F. Tvrdý dealt
with the highly topical problem of "science denial" and presented a
classification of types of epistemic deficits at both the individual and
societal levels that lead to such denial.

The contributions of the other participants of the conference can be roughly
divided into four thematic areas: 1. the relationship between nature and
humanity, or nature and society, 2. naturalism in (meta)ethics and the social
and moral consequences of accepting a naturalistic worldview, 3. various aspects
and persistent influences of Quine's concept of naturalized epistemology, 4.
reductive and non-reductive naturalism and its application in the study of
consciousness. 

Ivan Buraj presented Latour's concept of "hybridism" as a proposal for solving
the problem of the relationship between nature and society and defended it
against its critics. Richard Sťahel pointed out the necessary consequences and
changes that will occur in the near future in the basic principles of political
philosophy through the concept of the Anthropocene. 

Adam Greif attempted to explain morality as a shared identity using the
assumption of the existence of an extended self, which is capable of identifying
with any person or thing, in his lecture. Michal Chabada presented the concept
of natural law by Duns Scotus and showed its interesting aspects in the context
of contemporary metaethics. Erika Lalíková's contribution was devoted to the
important representative from the history of Slovak philosophy, Svätopluk Štúr,
and his critique of the moral and social consequences of naturalistic
philosophy. Mariana Szapuová identified Quinean elements in contemporary
feminist epistemology, while Martin Nuhlíček examined Quine's naturalized
epistemology in relation to the tension between its descriptive and normative
aspects.

In his presentation, Emil Višňovský offered a historical overview of various
forms of naturalism in American philosophy from the second half of the 19th
century to the present, while also defending a version of non-reductive
naturalism. Róbert Maco presented one possible naturalistic view on the
relationship between the "natural world" and the scientific (physical) image of
the world. Katarína Sklutová examined the possibilities of explaining phenomenal
consciousness from the perspective of Frankish's illusionism as one of the
naturalistic approaches in philosophy of mind.

I would like conclude with two remarks. There were several unplanned content and thematic overlaps
between some of the contributions during the conference, and it was interesting
to observe how different speakers approached the same topics (such as the theme
of moral progress, the relationship between the scientific image of the world
and common sense) from more or less different starting points. Secondly, it was
confirmed that the vitality of conference debates is invaluable when advocates
of diametrically opposed philosophical positions are present - in this case,
different types of naturalism as well as the contrast between resolute critics
of naturalism and equally determined supporters of this "universal philosophical
program."
