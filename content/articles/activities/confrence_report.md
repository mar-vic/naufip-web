The department of Philosophy and History of Philosophy organized a conference
(titled as *Naturalistic Image of the World: Challenges and Limits*) on 2.
and 3. september 2021, in order to present some results of our research project
(APVV-18-0178 *Naturalism as Universal Research Programme*). In addition to
talks given by the core members of our team, several foreing researchers have
also presented their ideas at the event.

The program of the conference consisted from contributions related to the theoretical issues we
are dealing with in the NAUFIP reasearch project, and its primary aims were to: a)
present a complex and critical outlook on the foundations and aims of naturalism, b)
make contributions to the analysis of progressive interpenetration of
naturalising approaches to the individual philosophical disciplines, c) evaluate
the internal limits of these approaches at points where they encounter
philosophical and methodological problems. All contributions of speakers were
thus primarily focused on the critical exploration of the main principles and
problems of naturalism within the context of various philosophical disciplines,
such as metaethics, epistemology, social philosophy or the philosophy of mind.

The first talk of the first day of the conference was given by a foreing guest
speaker Herlinde Pauer-Studer (Universtät Wien, Wien). In her presentation
*Naturalism versus Constructivism in Metaethics*, she was concerned with the
the possibility to combine the naturalism of Philippa Foot with the constructivism
of Christine Korsgaard. Following her was Adam Greif (Comenius University,
Bratislava) with the talk titled *Companions in Guilt: Ethics and Mathematics*,
in which he considered the possibility to model ethical justification on the
basis of justification of mathematical truths. Other speakers focused on
exploring various forms of naturalism: Emil Višňovský (Comenius University, Bratislava) introduced the basic
tenets of nonreductive naturalism (*Nonreductive Naturalism*), while Robert Maco
(Comenius University, Bratislava) dealt critically with objections against
ontological naturalism (*The Problems of Ontological Naturalism*). Then Filip
Tvrdý (Palacký University, Olomouc) argued against modal logic and possibilism
on the basis of their failure to satisfy Popper's criterion of falsifiability.
Final presentations of the first day of the conference were focused on
particular theoretical position within naturalism: Ivan Buraj (Comenius
University, Bratislava) have reflected on *Political Ecology and Its New
Challenges*; Erika Lalíková (Comenius University, Bratislava) was concerned with
*The Inteconnectedness of Literary and Philosophical Interpretation of
Naturalism*; and, finally, the talk given by Katarína Sklutková (Comenius
University, Bratislava) from the field of contemporary philosophy of mind
*Naturalistic Tendencies in Dennett's Philosophy of Consciousness*.

Second day of the conference was opened with the talk given by Michal Chabada
(Comenius University, Bratislava) with the title *Moral Facts in Neoaristotelian
Ethical Naturalism*, in which he was dealing with the consequences of Philippa
Foot's moral naturalism and thus following up on the talk by Herlinde
Pauer-Studer from the previous day. Petra Chudárková (Palacký University,
Olomouc) dedicated her presentation *Naturalized Ethics: From Description to
Normativity* to the possibility of making naturalistic transition from
descriptions to norms. In *Normative Dimension of Nautralized EPistemology*
Martin Nuhlíček (Comenius University, Bratislava) considered the attempt to
naturalise epistemology on the basis of the claim that epistemic rationality is
instrumental. The closing section of the conference was held in online space and
was attented by several foreing guest speakers. Roman Hloch (University of Ostrava)
followed up on the strand of previous ethical discussions and gave presentation
*Aristotelian Naturalistic Measure of Ethical Values*. Antonín Dolák (University
of Ostrava, Ostrava) reflected on the links between the existence of qualia,
consequentionalism and the development of general artificial intelligence in his
*Do Qualia exist? And Are They Viable Building Blocks For Ethics and General
Artificial Intelligence (AGI)?*. Finally, Radim Bělohrad presented a defense of
philosophical non-cognitivism in *Philosophy, Apriori Knowledge and Naturalism*.

All contributions excited number of stimulating discussions. One of their
central question was whether and to what extent is naturalism a dominant
philosophical position. The answer was usually contingent on the sense in which
the speaker was using the term "naturalism" and also relative to the
philosophical subdiscipline under consideration. Nevertheless, most of the
presentations were concerned with the use that redefines the nature of
philosophy *per se*, in response to the successes of natural sciences. Some
speakers have stressed the importance of naturalistic approaches, while others
defended more moderate positions, pointing out the possible limits in
naturalism's capacity to solve traditional philosophical problems, such as the
problem of moral facts in metaethics, or the mind-body problem in the philosophy
of mind. One of the conclusion generally accepted by the attendees of the
conference was that, going forward, it is necessary to explore the intersections
of various naturalistic approaches within individual philosophical disciplines.

Finally, we would like to thank all speakers as well as organizers for creating
exceedingly pleasant and scholarly atmosphere in this joint attempt to advance the
understanding of *naturalistic image of the world*.
